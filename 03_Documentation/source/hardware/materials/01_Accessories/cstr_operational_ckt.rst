working procedure
-----------------

The continuous operation control unit is a software-driven system engineered to maintain steady, predetermined inlet and outlet flow rates through precision-controlled pump operations. The flow rates are established based on experimentally determined residence times and are programmed prior to initiating the continuous reaction sequence.
