OVERVIEW
========

The continuous operation control unit is a software-driven system engineered to maintain steady, predetermined inlet and outlet flow rates through precision-controlled pump operations. The flow rates are established based on experimentally determined residence times and are programmed prior to initiating the continuous reaction sequence. The system comprises two primary pumps for inlet and outlet flow, as well as an auxiliary looping pump for internal circulation.
