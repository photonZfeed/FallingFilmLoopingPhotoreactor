UV-Visible Spectrophotometric Data
==================================

This directory contains UV-Visible spectrophotometric data collected for **pure reference compounds** used in the study. The data serve as baseline spectra for comparison in subsequent reaction and mixture analyses.
This directory also contains UV-Visible spectrophotometric data for the time-dependent reaction monitoring at various reactant concentrations (500 mM, 815 mM)

Folder structure Description:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

500 mM :
~~~~~~~~

This folder contains UV-Visible spectrophotometric data for the time-dependent reaction monitoring at a reactant concentration of 500 mM.

File naming convention:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- 1.0.txt → Spectrum recorded **0 minutes** after the reaction started
- 1.1.txt → Spectrum recorded **2 minutes** after the reaction started
- 1.2.txt → Spectrum recorded **4 minutes** after the reaction started
- and so on

815 mM scale :
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This folder contains UV-Visible spectrophotometric data for the time-dependent reaction monitoring at a reactant concentration of 815 mM.

File naming convention:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- 1.txt → Spectrum recorded **2 minutes** after the reaction started
- 2.txt → Spectrum recorded **4 minutes** after the reaction started
- 4.txt → Spectrum recorded **6 minutes** after the reaction started
and so on

BB and Toluene:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This folder contains UV-Visible spectrophotometric data collected for **pure reference compounds** used in the study (Benzyl bromide and Toluene).
benzyl_bromide.txt
This file contains the raw UV-Visible **spectrophotometric data** recorded for **pure benzyl bromide**.

toluene.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~

This file contains the **raw UV-Visible spectrophotometric data** recorded for pure toluene.

Notes
~~~~~

- All measurements were performed using a UV-Visible spectrophotometer.
- Experimental parameters (path length, wavelength range, and scan rate) were kept constant for both measurements unless stated otherwise.
