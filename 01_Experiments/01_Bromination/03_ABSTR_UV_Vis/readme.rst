UV–Visible Spectrophotometric Reference Data
============================================

This directory contains UV–Visible spectrophotometric data collected for
**pure reference compounds** used in the study.

The data serve as baseline spectra for comparison in
subsequent reaction and mixture analyses.

File Description
----------------

benzyl_bromide.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This file contains the **raw UV–Visible spectrophotometric data** recorded for
**pure benzyl bromide**.

---

toluene.txt
~~~~~~~~~~~
This file contains the **raw UV–Visible spectrophotometric data** recorded for
**pure toluene**.


Notes
-----
- All measurements were performed using a UV–Visible spectrophotometer.
- Experimental parameters (path length, wavelength range, and scan rate) were
  kept constant for both measurements unless stated otherwise.
