CSTR UV–Visible Spectrometer Data
=================================

This directory contains UV–Visible spectrometer data collected during the
reaction under different external flow-rate conditions. The data are organized
based on the flow rate at which the experiment was performed.

Each subfolder corresponds to a specific flow rate, and the files within each
folder represent time-resolved UV–Vis measurements collected after the reaction
started.

Folder Structure and Description
--------------------------------

3 mL·min⁻¹
~~~~~~~~~~
This folder contains UV–Visible spectrometer data recorded when the reaction was
performed at an external flow rate of **3 mL·min⁻¹**.

Each data file corresponds to a UV–Vis spectrum collected after a specific
reaction time.

**File naming convention:**

- ``t=2.txt`` → Spectrum recorded **2 minutes** after the reaction started  
- ``t=3.txt`` → Spectrum recorded **3 minutes** after the reaction started  
- ``t=4.txt`` → Spectrum recorded **4 minutes** after the reaction started  
- *and so on*

---

5 mL·min⁻¹
~~~~~~~~~~
This folder contains UV–Visible spectrometer data recorded when the reaction was
performed at an external flow rate of **5 mL·min⁻¹**.

- The experimental procedure and data collection method are identical to those
  used at 3 mL·min⁻¹.
- The file-naming strategy follows the same time-based convention.

**File naming convention:**

- ``t=2.txt`` → Spectrum recorded after **2 minutes**  
- ``t=3.txt`` → Spectrum recorded after **3 minutes**  
- ``t=4.txt`` → Spectrum recorded after **4 minutes**

Notes
-----
- All measurements were recorded using a UV–Visible spectrometer.
- Experimental conditions other than flow rate were kept constant unless stated
  otherwise.
